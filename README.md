## Usage

### 1. Loading an Image

-   Drag and drop your 3-frame image onto the upload area
-   Or click "Select File" to choose an image from your computer
-   Supported formats: JPEG, PNG

### 2. Frame Editing

After loading an image, you'll see three detected frames. For each frame:

1. Click the "Crop" button under any frame to enter edit mode
2. Use the blue cropping tool to adjust the frame boundaries:
    - Drag the corners/edges to resize
    - Drag inside the crop area to move it
    - The dimensions are shown in the top-right corner
3. Use the control buttons:
    - **Apply**: Save your crop adjustments
    - **Reset Crop**: Return to the initial crop position
    - **Cancel**: Exit without saving changes

### 3. Creating the GIF

1. Click "Create GIF" after you're satisfied with the frames
2. In the output modal, you can:
    - Preview the animation
    - Adjust animation speed (0.5x, 1x, 2x)
    - Save the GIF using either:
        - Quick Save: Saves to an 'animated' folder in the source directory
        - Save As: Choose your save location

### 4. Additional Controls

-   **Reset**: Start over with a new image (top-right corner)
-   **Upload Another**: Load a new image after creating a GIF

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Frames not detecting properly:**

    - Ensure your image has three distinct frames
    - Try adjusting the crop manually

2. **GIF creation fails:**

    - Check that all frames are properly cropped
    - Ensure you have sufficient disk space

3. **Application not starting:**
    - Verify Node.js is properly installed
    - Try reinstalling dependencies with `npm install`
    - Check console for error messages
